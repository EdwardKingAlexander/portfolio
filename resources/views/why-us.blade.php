        </h1>
        <p class="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">With a decade of business to business sales experience, in addition to our web application design and implementation experience, we understand that each business has a unique set of goals and needs in order to maximize their business</p>
      </div>
      <div class="mx-auto mt-6 prose prose-lg text-gray-500 prose-blue">
        <p>While no two businesses are exactly the same, we understand that <strong>all</strong> businesses invest in products and services that will <strong>grow their customer base</strong>. Developing an effective website is more than just making a site that looks good. A truly effective website will have several things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research into not only the customers you want to taget, but also research into what those customers look for when trying to find a business like you.</li>
          <li>Effective design to capture the attention of the audience.</li>
          <li>A clear purpose of the website and an easy way to take that action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is where we really shine. Many businesses can get a very cheap website done that looks appealing. Many times however, the focus is purely on how the website looks, and not on targeting a specific client base. Imagine paying for a billboard selling sand, only to have it up in the desert. People may see it, but the wrong people.</p>

        <h2>We focus on business growth</h2>
        <p>We take a business first approach in order to maximize your client base. Designing and devloping an website is the easy part, targeting the right customers and getting them to take action is where tangible results come from with an online presence. Focusing on this first, allows us to design and implement everything else around it, giving you a significantly higher chance of increasing your sales.</p>

          <figcaption>Increased sales and/or reduced expenses is how businesses grow.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Technical expertise</h2>
        <p>When it comes to developing web applications and websites, there are many different technologies that can be used. While we focus on a particular technology to develop the majority of our services, we have the technical expertise to use many other technolgies. Our network of programmers allows us to complete almost any project according to your specific needs.</p>

        <p>So, why us? Because our background working with businesses in so many different industries gives us an edge over the many companies that design and develop websites. We focus on results, because thats what matters.</p>
